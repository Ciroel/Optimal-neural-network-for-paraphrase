## Abstract
The paper addresses the problem of choosing the optimal recurrent neural network. In this paper the optimal criteria is evidence lower bound. The paper investigates variational inference methods to approximate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. As a particular case the normal distribution of the parameters with different types of the covariance matrix is investigated. The authors propose a method of pruning parameters with the highest probability density in zero to increase the model marginal likelihood. As an illustrative example, a computational experiment of multiclass classification on SemEval 2015 dataset have been carried out.
